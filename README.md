Working my way through these scraping tasks.

## My issues so far:

* Script 9: I think the difference of "yeas" and "nays" *(nays-yeas)* should be *abs(nays-yeas)*.

> E.g: With [Vote 270 (47-52)](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&session=1&vote=00270), the (nays - yeas) = 5. 
> 
> [Vote 273 (50-44)](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&session=1&vote=00273), (nays - yeas) = -6. 
> 
> Both were rejected, by the latter would count towards the margin being less than five. Using the absolute value of the difference would reject both these cases. 

* Script 36: The original script sums number of visits, not number of *visitors*.

* Script 56: Doesn't return correct number.

## Search-Script-Scrape: 101 webscraping and research tasks for the data journalist

__Note:__ This exercise set is part of the [Stanford Computational Journalism Lab](http://cjlab.stanford.edu). I've also written [a blog post that gives a little more elaboration about the libraries used and a few of the exercises](http://blog.danwin.com/examples-of-web-scraping-in-python-3-x-for-data-journalists/).

-------------

This repository contains [101 Web data-collection tasks](#the-tasks) in Python 3 that I assigned to my [Computational Journalism class in Spring 2015](http://www.compjour.org) to give them regular exercise in programming and conducting research, and to expose them to the variety of data published online.

The hard part of many of these tasks is researching and finding the actual data source. The scripts need only concern itself with fetching the data and printing the answer in the least painful way possible. Since the [Computational Journalism class](http://www.compjour.org) wasn't intended to be an actual programming class, adherence to idioms and best codes practices was not emphasized...(especially since I'm new to Python myself!)

Some examples of the tasks:

- [The California city whose city manager has the highest total wage per capita in 2012](https://github.com/compjour/search-script-scrape/blob/master/scripts/100.py) ([expanded version](scratchpad/high_city_ca_pay.py))
- [In the most recently transcribed Supreme Court argument, the number of times laughter broke out](https://github.com/compjour/search-script-scrape/blob/master/scripts/50.py) ([expanded version](scratchpad/more_scotus_laughs.py))
- [Number of days until Texas's next scheduled execution](scripts/29.py)
- [The U.S. congressmember with the most Twitter followers](https://github.com/compjour/search-script-scrape/blob/master/scripts/90.py)
- [The number of people who visited a U.S. government website using Internet Explorer 6.0 in the last 90 days](https://github.com/compjour/search-script-scrape/blob/master/scripts/3.py)

## Repo status



The table below links to the available scripts. If there's not a link, it means I haven't committed the code. Some of them I had to rethink a less verbose solution (or the target changed, as the Internet sometimes does), and now this repo has taken a backseat to many other data projects on my list. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` 

Note: A lot of the code is not best practice. The tasks are a little repetitive so I got bored and [ignored PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and/or tried new libraries/conventions for fun.



__Note:__ The "__related URL__" links to either the official source of the data, or at least a page with some background information. The second column of this table refers to __line count__ of the script, __not__ the answer to the prompt.

## The tasks

## How to run this stuff

Each task is meant to be a self-contained script: you run it, and it prints the answer I'm looking for. The [scripts](/scripts) in this repo should "just work"...if you have all the dependencies installed that I had while writing them, and the web URLs they target haven't changed...so, basically, these may not work at all.

To copy the scripts quickly via the command-line; by default, a ./search-script-scrape directory will be created:

``` 
$ git clone https://github.com/compjour/search-script-scrape.git
```

To run a script:

``` 
$ cd search-script-scrape
$ python3 scripts/1.py
```

I leave it to you and Google to figure out how to run Python 3 on your own system. FWIW, I was using the [Python 3.4.3 provided by the Anaconda 2.2.0 installer for OS X](http://continuum.io/downloads#py34). The most common third-party libraries used are [Requests](http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/) for downloading the files and [lxml for HTML parsing](http://lxml.de/).

## Expanding on these scripts

To reiterate: each of these scripts are meant to print out single answers, and so they don't actually show the full potential of how programming can automate data collection. As you get better at programming and recognizing its patterns, you'll find out how easy it is to abstract what seemed like a narrow task into something much bigger.

For example, [Script #50](scripts/50.py) prints out the number of times laughter broke out in the _most recently_ transcribed Supreme Court argument. Change two lines and that script will print out the laugh count in _every_ transcribed Supreme Court argument: ([demo here](scratchpad/more_scotus_laughs.py))

The same kind of small code restructuring can be done to many of the tasks here. And you can also modify the _parameters_; why limit yourself to finding the [highest paid "City Manager" in California](https://github.com/compjour/search-script-scrape/blob/master/scripts/100.py) when you can extend the search to every kind of California employee, across every year of salary data? ([demo here](scratchpad/high_city_ca_pay.py))

And of course, in real-world data projects, you aren't typically interested in just printing the answer to your Terminal. You generally want to send them to a spreadsheet or spreadsheet and eventually to a web application (or other kind of publication). That's just a few more lines of programming, too...So while this repo contains a bunch of toy scripts, see if you can think of ways to turn them into bigger data explorations.



## Post-mortem

The original requirement was that students finish all 100 scripts by the end of the quarter. That didn't quite work out so I reduced the requirement to 50. It was a bad idea to make this a "oh, just turn it in at the end of the year", as most people have the tendency to wait for finals week to do such work.

Most of the tasks are pretty straightforward, in terms of the Python programming. The majority of the time is figuring out exactly what the hell I'm referring to, so next time I do this, I'll probably provide the URL of the target page rather than having people attempt to divine the Google Path I used to get to the data.
